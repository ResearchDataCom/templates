# Contribution Guidelines

The project practices [test-driven development](https://tdd.mooc.fi/)
in
[Git feature (topic) branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
Please maintain a [linear commit history](https://archive.is/VpWTs) by
rebasing changes on the latest HEAD of the main branch before
submitting them for review as a
[GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

## Development Environment

:::{admonition} Guidance

This project **REQUIRES** [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/),
[OpenTofu](https://www.opentofu.org/) 1.12, and
[Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.12 or newer.

:::

Additionally, on Linux it needs
[lsb-release](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml).  On
macOS it uses the
[Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/installing-the-command-line-tools)
and [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).  Several of the available
make targets are listed below.  Review the
[makefile](github:GNUmakefile) for additional details.

`make build-deps`
: Install the remaining system-level build dependencies.  Requires
  root access via [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/).

`make setup`
: Create (or update) a
  [Python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments)
  named `.venv` in the project root directory and perform an editable
  installation of this project that includes development and testing
  tools.

`make pre-commit`
: Configure optional pre-commit hooks, which require the virtual
  environment to be active in your code editor or
  [Git porcelain](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain).

`make lint`
: Check code syntax and style.

`make clean`
: Reset the development environment, which includes removing the
  pre-commit hooks.

## Code Style

:::{admonition} Guidance

Changes **MUST** be self-contained and buildable, with updated tests
and documentation.

:::

This project follows these code styles:

- [Python Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/)
  and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)

- [the Google Markdown style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html),
  but with a more traditional 70-character line limit

- [the Home Assistant YAML style guide](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/documenting/yaml-style-guide/)

## Commit Messages

:::{admonition} Guidance

This project **REQUIRES**
[Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/),
with which it implements
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

:::

In commit messages:

- Please use English.

- Limit the first line to at most 100 characters.  Wrap the rest of
  the commit message at column 70.

- Summarize the changes with a one-sentence commit description in the
  imperative mood, lowercasing the starting verb and omitting ending
  punctuation.

- For the commit type, specify one of {term}`build`, {term}`chore`,
  {term}`ci`, {term}`docs`, {term}`feat`, {term}`fix`, {term}`perf`,
  {term}`style`, {term}`refactor`, or {term}`test`.

## Commit Scopes

:::{admonition} Guidance

Per _Conventional Commits_, a commit scope is an **OPTIONAL**
abbreviation, acronym, codename, or keyword that provides additional
context to reviewers by naming the essential component of the change.
Changes covering multiple scopes or changes not specific to one scope
**MUST NOT** specify a scope.

:::

An atomic commit can alter multiple files.  For example, an interface
change could require modifications to class definitions, method calls,
property references, and unit tests throughout the project.  The
commit scope tells reviewers where to focus their analysis.  In change
logs, commit scopes help sponsors understand the structure of the work
going into fixes, features, or breaking changes.  For OpenTofu
resource definition changes, commit scopes specify the OpenTofu
submodule containing the code instigating the change, not changes
instigated by code in top-level resource definitions like
[main.tf](github:main.tf).
